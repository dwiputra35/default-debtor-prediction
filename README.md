# default-debtor-prediction
In this project, I have developed a classification model that predicts whether a debtor will fail to make payments in the next month. Utilizing a dataset that encompasses the relationship between existing features and the default payment status feature. Consequently, the resulting model can be used to provide insights to financial institutions in identifying higher credit risks and taking appropriate preventive measures to manage the risk.

By predicting the default status of debtors, financial institutions can take necessary actions, such as issuing warnings to potentially defaulting debtors or proactively adjusting credit limits. Additionally, this model can serve as a valuable tool in credit assessment and risk management decision-making.

For this task, I have chosen to evaluate the model using the recall metric, as it focuses on accurately predicting (true positives) individuals who are likely to default (1).

This model achieved an 82% recall score for classifying the 'default' class and an 82% accuracy score.
